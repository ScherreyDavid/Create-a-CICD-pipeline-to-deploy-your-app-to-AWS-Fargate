# Created a CICD Pipeline to Deploy app to AWS Fargate

I created a CI/CD pipeline to deploy my app to AWS Fargate using CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy. I configured CodeCommit as a source control repository and created a CodeDeploy application and deployment group. I built a CI/CD pipeline that performed a blue/green deployment
## Tasks

Task 1: Explore the application and review the Fargate configuration
